## "Running your own cake shop"

This is a game of running a cake shop. In this game, player can:

- **Buy materials** from the market
- **Make cakes** with the material inventory
- Set price and **sell cakes** to the residents of a town and earn money

The game is design for players who want to **experience running a cake shop** , and
players who **enjoy the trade off strategy**. My original intention to make this game 
is I enjoy the strategy game myself.

**Enjoy it!**
